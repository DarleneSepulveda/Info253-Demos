      <p> The following is an effortless poem, with grammatical errors: </p>
      <p>
        Midnight, is the time where black cats roam, where luck is lost and forests are not homes. <br> 
        Midnight, is a form of quiet, as people go and rest, sleep is their own makeshift diet. <br> 
        Midnight, is when people lie awake, restless and sweaty, their bed is too warm, their mind isn't steady. <br> 
        Midnight, is students, who lie awake and study, turning assignments in late, when they know it isn't <b> ready. </b>
